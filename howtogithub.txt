This is where I am going to store the commands that I will be using frequently throughout the semester

Adding file from terminal to my github account:
git add **
git commit -m "description"
git push

Moving files to a different directory from the source directory:
mv ** directory

Cloning a repository to nimoy to create directories
git clone repo_URL

Updating a directory if files are added to the repository:
go to current version of repository
git pull
